## Expense App: A Three-Tier Web Application Deployed with Docker ðŸš€

My **Expense app** is a robust **three-tier web application** that I've successfully deployed using **Docker**.

This means the application is structured into three distinct, interconnected parts:

1.  **Frontend:** This is what users see and interact with (the web interface).
2.  **Backend:** This handles the application logic, processing requests from the frontend.
3.  **Database:** This stores all the expense data.

By using **Docker**, I've packaged each of these tiers into isolated containers. This makes the application highly portable, easy to deploy, and ensures it runs consistently across different environments.
